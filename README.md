# SCVis @FMI

A simple data visualisation application used to visualise the data of all people that finished highschool in Bulgaria in 2020.
The idea is that using this visualisation tool you can easily see trends or export the data to a `.jpeg` or a `.png` file or even to paper by printing it.

## App structure

The app is structured with a Frontend done in React (JS) with React-Bootstrap, also CanvasJS and PapaParse are used to visualise and append the data.

## Updates

Feel free to make pull requests for me to update the simple yet interesting example app! :)

## To start

    1. Install npm.
    2. Run a `npm install` inside the ReactJS folder.
    3. Run a `npm start` inside the same folder.
    4. Select the `.csv` file inside the /data subfolder and watch the magic unfold.
